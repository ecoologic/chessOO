# A Ruby Chess~ish Game

I will never finish this, I'm just interested in some of the challenges in its development.

## Notes

* I've been careful with dependency direction
* I know I used a sequence diagram instead of a class diagram, I just like the tool
* Naming, modularity and readability is to my satisfaction
* It's almost TDD
* I usually don't leave TODOs in the master branch when working in a team
* It's a good expression of my current (2019) mastery of the Ruby language

## Installation

```
bin/bundle
bin/rspec
```

That's it, there are only specs.

## Development

Keep guard up, write some spec and make it green.

```
bin/guard
```
